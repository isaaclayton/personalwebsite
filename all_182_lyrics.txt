13 miles down the road lives a young boy Hes got jet black hair and blue green eyes And he's mine. And every now and then he and i will sit together on the porch And i take off his pants and i fuck him from behind And  I love him for his mind and soul And  I love his wrinkled scrotum too. So if you see us passing by on some dreary rainy day Take a look at the young boy and his naked...  ass-hole
 My mind wanders as  I'm trying not to fall in love with you' Cause every time  I awake  I ponder on my mistakes of What  I said, it is always my esteem that  I sure lose Playing those stupid games as  I always end up chasing you I can't help myself anymore Rehearsing my thoughts as  I'm too scared to come to your door I pushed it all aside just to stand next to you But now you won't talk to me for something that  I didn't do It's not gonna work And  I'm trying not to think of you I'm all confused as  I think of the things that  I would do I'm all shook up as  I get all nervous inside My emotions are something that  I will always hide
 Oh  Elise it doesn't matter what you say I just can't sit here every yesterday Like keep on acting out the same The way we act out Let me wait to smile Forget And make-believe we never needed Any more than this Any more than this Oh  Elise it doesn't matter what you do I know  I'll never really get inside of you To make your eyes catch fire The way they should The way the blue could pull me in If they only would If they only would At least  I'd lose this sense of sensing something else That hides away For me and you: they're worlds to part With aching looks and breaking hearts And all the plans your hands can make Oh  I just take as much as you can throw And then  I'll throw it all away And then  I'll throw it all away Like throwing faces at the sky Like throwing arms round Yesterday I stood and stared Wide-eyed in front of you And the face  I saw looked back The way  I wanted to But  I just can't hold my tears away The way you do Elise believe  I never wanted this I thought this time  I'd keep all of my promises I thought you were the girl  I always dreamed about But  I let the dream go And the promises broke And the make-believe ran out... So  Elise It doesn't matter what you say I just can't stay here every yesterday Like keep on acting out the same The way we act out Let me wait to smile Forget And make-believe we never needed Any more than this Any more than this And every time  I try to pick it up Like falling sand As fast as  I pick it up It runs away through my clutching hands But there's nothing else  I can really do There's nothing else  I can really do There's nothing else I can really do At all...
 I've got her in my head At night when  I go to bed And  I know it sounds lame, but She's the girl of my dreams And of course  I'd do anything for her I'd search the moons of  Endor I'd even walk naked through The deserts of  Tatooine Princess  Leia, where are you tonight? And who's laying there by your side? Every night  I fall asleep with you And  I wake up alone And even though  I'm not as cool as  Han I still want to be your man You're exactly the kind of Alderranian that  I need But when you were available,  I was Drinking  Colt 45's with  Lando I was hanging out in the cantina On  Mos  Eisley Princess  Leia, where are you tonight? And who's laying there by your side? Every night  I fall asleep with you And  I wake up alone Princess  Leia [2x] Princess  Leia, where are you tonight? And who's laying there by your side? Every night  I fall asleep with you And  I wake up alone
 Stranger walking to my side I cannot wait  I cannot hide To you it's so obvious That  I'm just the average guy But wont you see No emotions Wont even cry

Look to the past and remember her smile And maybe tonight  I can breathe for awhile I'm not in the scene,  I think  I'm fallin' asleep But then all that it means is  I'll always be dreamin' of you Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer Place your hand in mine I'll leave when  I wanna Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer Place your hand in mine I'll leave when  I wanna Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer (so lost and disillusioned) Place your hand in mine I'll leave when  I wanna (so lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time (are we alone do you feel it) Your smile fades in the summer (so lost and disillusioned) Place your hand in mine (are we alone do you feel it) I'll leave when  I wanna (so lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time (are we alone do you feel it) Your smile fades in the summer (so lost and disillusioned) Place your hand in mine (are we alone do you feel it) I'll leave when  I wanna (so lost and disillusioned)
 I never thought  I'd die alone I laughed the loudest who'd have known I traced the cord back to the wall No wonder it was never plugged in at all I took my time,  I hurried up The choice was mine,  I didn't think enough I'm too depressed, to go on You'll be sorry when  I'm gone I never conquered, rarely came16 just held such better days Days when  I still felt alive We couldn't wait to get outside The world was wide, too late to try The tour was over we'd survived I couldn't wait till  I got home To pass the time in my room alone I never thought  I'd die alone Another six months  I'll be unknown Give all my things to all my friends You'll never step foot in my room again You'll close it off, board it up Remember the time that  I spilled the cup Of apple juice in the hall Please tell mom this is not her fault I never conquered, rarely came16 just held such better days Days when  I still felt alive We couldn't wait to get outside The world was wide, too late to try The tour was over but we'd survived I couldn't wait till  I got home To pass the time in my room alone I never conquered, rarely came Tomorrow holds such better days Days when  I could still feel alive When  I can't wait to get outside The world is wide, the time goes by The tour is over  I survived And  I can't wait till  I get home To pass the time in my room alone

 She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving The good intentions that you had Now only came to this And although she saw the mark The arrow missed It isn't exciting reciting the stories Of kind words turned hurting when routine get boring Both getting tired of punk rock clubs And both playing in punk rock bands The start was something good But some good things must end And she said, " It could never survive With such differing lives One home, one out on tour again We may never come back The strike of a match The candle's buring at both ends.

( No we ain't gonna take it unless it's from a doverman pincher Ladies and gentlemen, for your listening pleasure,  Blink) Passively one day as the sun rose out of it's house So did this little old guy as he whistled out of his mouth And happily and gay Well  I guessed exactly that Because he found a special girl That put him in a special trance He fell in love so quickly What the hell was he to expect That the girl under his arm wasn't the same As any other girl That he had thought that he once met I guess you could only blame fate Things started getting weird as they started to kiss She often felt his beard and remembered how her father she missed And then quietly one day He sang a song from deep within his heart Causing some ingestion He finished with a great big fart and She knew at that one moment That song was something she heard before So she asked him to do that again Then out the door they hurried She was gonna find out for sure So she analyzed his rear end She said, " When  I was a little girl my dad left my mom. He used to always fart and sing this special song. Now  I wasn't quite so sure until your pants did fall.' Cause now  I know that your my dad because you use ben wah balls." I said a wah, wah, wah-wah-wah, Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah... Ben wah ball wah, wah, wah-wah-wah, Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah...

Rubs your eyes and miss your head All you have is meat and you're a vegetarian Put in your key and your car won't start Your wife just left you and she took the sports car All alone and it's one of those days Oh my god you found out your neighbor's gay Better days that you had And you blame it on fate You've got a bitter feeling in the back of your head And concentration's asleep How do you do the things you do And go on living your life?

You beat your kids all the time And you constantly yell at your wife

[ Verse 1:  Mark  Hoppus] There's an echo pulling out the meaning Rescuing a nightmare from a dream The voices in my head are always screaming That none of this means anything to me[ Pre- Chorus:  Mark  Hoppus] And it's a long way back from seventeen The whispers turn into a scream And  I'm not coming home[ Chorus:  Matt  Skiba +  Mark  Hoppus] Save your breath,  I'm nearly Bored to death and fading fast Life is too short to last long Back on earth  I'm broken Lost and cold and fading fast Life is too short to last long[ Verse 2:  Matt  Skiba] There's a stranger staring at the ceiling Rescuing a tiger from a tree The pictures in her head are always dreaming Each of them means everything to me[ Pre- Chorus:  Matt  Skiba] And it's a long way back from seventeen The whispers turn into a scream And  I'm not coming home[ Chorus:  Mark  Hoppus] Save your breath,  I'm nearly Bored to death and fading fast Life is too short to last long Back on earth  I'm broken Lost and cold and fading fast Life is too short to last long[ Bridge:  Mark  Hoppus] I think  I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down I said  I'm sorry  I'm a bit of a let down But all my friends are daring me to come over So  I come over and over and over So let me buy you a drink And we'll pretend that you think That  I'm the man of your dreams Come to life in a dive bar And we'll go over and over and over And we'll go over and over and over And we'll go over and over and over And we'll go over and over and over[ Chorus:  Mark  Hoppus] Save your breath,  I'm nearly Bored to death and fading fast Life is too short to last long Back on earth  I'm broken Lost and cold and fading fast Life is too short to last long[ Outro:  Matt  Skiba] Oh oh, oh oh Oh oh, oh oh...

 Let's get started, the faint and broken-hearted,  Hold it up,  I've got something  I cannot hide. Worst painkiller, that all-in filler,  The apart and departed look in my eyes. Sad, how far you ran,  I'll search this land,  Up through the clouds then back here. We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb,  At all hours. I'm empty like the day after christmas,  Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye. You left me on the day after christmas,  There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight. I will follow the trail to tomorrow,  With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night. Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers. Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind. Sad, how far you ran,  I'll search this land,  Up through the clouds then back here. We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb,  At all hours. I'm empty like the day after christmas,  Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye. You left me on the day after christmas,  There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight. I'm empty like the day after christmas,  Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye. You left me on the day after christmas,  There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight. Goodnight
 You put a bullet in my head, The sorrow makes me eat bread, The bread tastes like shit, Damn,  I shouldn't of shot, the shot Was not meant for the Bullet in my head.
 When you talk about tomorrow I'm not sure about today When you tell me that you love me What am  I supposed to say? Sometimes  I don't feel The same way as you feel Words like forever They scare the shit out of me Maybe  I'm afraid of commitment Maybe you're too distracted to see that Sometimes  I don't feel The same way as you feel I think of all the things  I'd say to you if  I had the chance again I think of all the things  I'd scream But  I think it's for the best That you and  I just don't connect and Things are never quite what they seem Will there ever be Someone to give her heart to me Or would  I be to blind to see it I wouldn't make a sound I'd keep it underground It always seems like  I'm running around around Running around around Round Sometimes  I don't feel The same way as you feel
 I talk to you every now and then I never felt so alone again I stop to think at a wishing well My thoughts send me on a carousel Here  I am standing on my own Not a motion from the telephone I know not a reason why Solitudes a reason to die Just you wait and see As school life is a It is a woken dream Aren't you feeling alone? I guess it's just another I guess it's just another I guess it's just another night alone Now as  I walk down the street I need a job just to sleep in sheets Buying food every once in a while But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me I know now that nothing is free I talk to you every now and then I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see As school life is a It is a woken dream Aren't you feeling alone? I guess it's just another I guess it's just another I guess it's just another night alone
 There's a  Cynical feeling Saying  I should give up You said everything you'll ever say There's a moment of panic When  I hear the phone ring Anxiety's calling in my head Is it back again Are you back again Don't wake me up before you leave Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed I feel your hand unlock the door Of leaving fingerprints of water in the oil What's the point of saying sorry now? Lost my voice while fighting my way out( Fighting my way out) What's the point of saying sorry now?( Not sorry,  Not sorry,  Not sorry,  I'm not sorry) Lost my voice while fighting my way out( Not sorry,  Not sorry,  Not sorry,  I'm not sorry now)

 The *exact* lyrics (100%) are: I was cruisin' in my  Stingray late one night, When an  X K E pulled up on the right. He rolled down the window of his shiny new  Jag, And challenged me then and there to a drag. I said " You're on buddy, my mill's runnin' fine, Let's pop off the line now, at  Sunset and  Vine. But  I'll pull you one better if you've got the nerve, Let's race all the way...to  Dead  Man's  Curve." Dead  Man's  Curve (that's no place to play) Dead  Man's  Curve (you must keep away) Dead  Man's  Curve ( I can hear 'em say) Won't come back from  Dead  Man's  Curve The street was deserted late  Friday night, We were buggin' each other while we sat at the light. We both popped the clutch when the light turned green. You should'a heard the whine from my screamin' machine. I flew past  La Brea,  Schwabs, and  Crescent  Heights, And all the  Jag could see were my six tailights. He past me at  Doheny then  I started to swerve. But  I pulled her out and there we were at, Dead  Man's  Curve (that's no place to play) Dead  Man's  Curve... Well the last thing  I remember  Doc  I started to swerve, And then  I saw the  Jag slide into the curve. I know  I'll never forget that horrible sight, I guess  I found out for myself that everyone was right. Won't come back from  Dead  Man's  Curve Dead  Man's  Curve (that's no place to play) Dead  Man's  Curve (you must keep away) Dead  Man's  Curve ( I can hear 'em say) Won't come back from  Dead  Man's  Curve(repeat to fadeout)

 Who makes up all the rules about those girls  I want? Who tells them all to laugh? Who tells them all to talk about me? And  I'm not sure what my purpose is for being here Why do they, why do they Always kick me in the groin when  I come near And  I'm not complaining it just hurts after a bit. I don't know what  I'm feeling I'm just so sick of seeing All those dumb, lame, and retarded broads Who often just sit kick back As  I am not so relaxed I often wonder why they act so odd Because no worse a time When it's just your time to Think you should make your move It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse What about that situation All night procrastination Takes you to the point when you lead her to her door There is nothing left there to say I guess you best be on your way But before you go you got to do that chore No worse a time When it's just your time to Think you should make your move It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse Please won't you buy in I'm always tryin' I keep on tryin' There's only so much pride that  I can lose I hope that when you see me You see right through me Come on now, honestly I'm so sick of endin' up without a clue

 Elevator  Lyrics[ Tom] The building turned it's back ignored my call, The concrete looks too thin to break my fall, The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene, I counted people as  I neared the street below, Whoa-oa-oa Below Whoa-oa-oa[ Mark] I saw it all  I saw it all go down, The shadow grew as he approached the ground, The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene, They turned away as he came near the street below, Whoa-oa-oa Below Whoa-oa-oa Below Whoa-oa-oa[ Tom] Lets forget this all move on[ Mark] Lets forget this all move on[ Tom] Lets forget this all move on[ Mark] Lets forget this all move on[ Tom] Lets forget this all move on[ Mark] Lets forget this all move on[ Tom] Lets forget this all move on
 One more time you will laugh about it And he'll never try to give you more And  I don't care, he is such a dick He treats you like you are a stupid whore And it seems like things will never change You go on, every cloud is in your way And  I know you feel empty all the time You'll never listen to anything that  I say She's better off sleeping on the floor Because she fell right off When all Is said You know It's okay to just want more Why leave when you claim it is love? But why stay when you're not the only one? She's proved she's strong Be brave, be strong She's better off sleeping on the floor Because she fell right off When all Is said You know It's okay to just want more She's better off sleeping on the floor She's better off sleeping on the floor( Because she fell right off the bed) She's better off sleeping on the floor She's better off sleeping on the floor( Because she fell right off the bed) She's better off sleeping on the floor She's better off sleeping on the floor( Because she fell right off the bed) She's better off sleeping on the floor She's better off sleeping on the floor( Because she fell right off the bed)
 Am  I, Strung out, Crazy? Or not allowed to be the one who Gets stupid over you? Lazy,( Lazy) Laidback,( Laidback) Maybe you're just on crack? Why am  I the one who gets fucked up and confused? Go! She doesn't care at all, She doesn't care at all, She doesn't care about those times we never Shared at all, If  I were the last, Of the few who always ask, Would you still be the same person that  I knew? And  If it's for me, Another boring sotry, I swear  I'll act enthused...
 And there she was Like a starry night Like a  Ferris wheel Full of blue green eyes And a heart of steel Always on her own Almost never real When the night will begin The pain it won't end Even if she falls in love Fact You wanna turn back Your heart will attack Even if she falls in love And there she was Like a blade of ice Like a  Lonely road Clear day of life Always sharp and cold Always beautiful I am such a fool When the night will begin The pain it won't end Even if she falls in love Fact You wanna turn back Your heart will attack Even if she falls in love Try to look in her eyes The light is just right Even if she falls in love And it isn't so bad It's driving you mad Even if she falls in love
 Never found out why you left him, But this answer begs a question, Too blind to see tomorrow, Too broke to beg or borrow. Young and  Stupid, left wide open Hearts are wasted, lives are broken One more point of contention, I need some intervention Approaching failing tensions, Betray my short attention span The distance, bridge the border Beg forgiveness, round the corner Everytime  I look for you the sun goes down And  I stumble when this whole thing runs aground I left another message, you are never around But every time  I look for you the sun goes down once more Will the last one out, please shut the door More time apart will give you, A few more months to argue Is this to much to live through, It always seems too far to drive The point home, send more letters Pray tomorrow, ends up better Everytime  I look for you the sun goes down And  I stumble when this whole thing runs aground I left another message, you are never around But everytime  I look for you the sun goes down once more Will the last one out, please shut the door I never did do anything that she asked, I never let what happened, stay in the past I never did quite understand what she meant, In spite of everything, in spite of everything Everytime  I look for you the sun goes down And  I stumble when this whole thing runs aground I left another message, you are never around But everytime  I look for you the sun goes down And  I stumble when this whole thing runs aground I left another message, you are never around But everytime  I look for you the sun goes down

 At the risk of sounding rude Just who the fuck do you think you are To tell me what you expect of me today? Well, you can take your attitude You're out of luck, you've gone way too far If you think there's any chance  I'm gonna stay How long can  I string you along? How little of myself can  I give And still make you believe  I care? At the risk of sounding trite Why the fuck do you think you're right About every little thing that you say? And do you think that it is right For  Tom to spend another night Writing songs about all the people he thinks are gay? How long can  I string you along? How little of myself can  I give And still make you believe  I care? How long can  I string you along How little of myself can  I give And still make you believe  I care?

 In the car,  I just can't wait... To pick you up on our very first date Is it cool if  I hold your hand? Is it wrong if  I think it's lame to dance? Do you like my stupid hair?

 I'll never let you down boy,  I'll never let you go, Her subtle hint of life is so innocent and scary. So tell me you are here boy, she says as if she knows, When  God took her with time,  God made me quite alone. It's like the universe has left me, without a place to go, Without a hint of light, to watch the movement glow. When our song was slowly starting,  Your memory felt so real, At first against my will, but  God invented chills. Yeah  I,  I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real, If your eyes stay right on mine,  My wounds would start to heal. The  Kids are in a hurry and  I'm just full of fear, The lights make bodies blurry, it's getting hard to enough to hear, It's like the evidence is cared for, and evendently clear, If  I never leave this dance floor,  I'll never leave you here Yeah  I,  I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real, If your eyes stay right on mine,  My wounds would start to heal I felt your ghost tonight, and  God it felt like hell To know you're almost mine, but dreams are all  I feel. Yeah  I,  I saw your ghost tonight,  It fucking hurt like hell, I felt you here tonight,  But dreams can't all be real (twice)
 Mom and dad they quite don't understand it, All the kids they laugh as if they planned it Why do girls wanna pierce their nose, And walk around in torn pantyhose, oh yeah I like the kids who say they listen to the punk rock I like the kids who fight against how they were brought up, They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care, It's cool when this piss people off with what they wear, oh yeah So give me one good reason, Why we need to be like them Kids will have fun and offend, They don't want and don't fit in Hate the jocks and preps, the hippie fuckin' scum bags Heavy metalers with their awful pussy hair bands Counting seconds until we can get our way, Ditching school almost every single day, oh yeah So give me one good reason, Why we need to be like them Kids will have fun and offend, They don't want to and don't fit in So give me one good reason, Why we need to be like them Kids will have fun and offend, They don't want to and don't fit in

 Take off the gloves We fell in love by the side of the road This desert will break you down The veins you cut Your smoking tongue is the end of us all But you only care about Fame and fortune Watching others tortured Casting your reflection Grocery store perfection This is the last time Sent to the front line With dirty boots on the ground You said  I'll make this all mine. You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone. Blackjack and architect Let's drink ourselves to death The crimes of everyone Passed down from father to son Hopeless and destitute Destroyed my gratitude Your strongest lines of defense Are all just self-inflicted wounds.

 I hear the phone, it rings so violently. Can't leave my room, can't breathe since she left me. I will admit,  I hate those things  I said. Girls always cry,  Guys will never admit they did. Hold on...  Hold on...  Hold on...  Hold on... Don't tell me that it's over,  I'm not used to this temptation. And when you come back runnin' there's no use for explaination. I think that things are too hopeful, even with my expert knowledge. Most girls do mean trouble because they are rarely honest. What's with the jokes, all the rutines they play? Screw with my head, never give in til they get their way. Guys like to run,  Chicks love to yell you see. Guys hate to fight girls think it's therapy. Hold on...  Hold on...  Hold on...  Hold on... Don't tell me that it's over,  I'm not used to this temptation. And when you come back runnin' there's no use for explaination. I think that things are too hopeful, even with my expert knowledge.

 Stop banging away on my kaleidoscope. Stop draining the color out of my scene. Just play me something  I can dance to. I can dance to anything you wanna sing. So lock me up in the studio. Fill it up with sound and scenarios. Stop blocking the driveway with your car.  Put the butterfly in the bell jar. It's the first time that  I'm worried,  Of a bad dream, of a journey, on the highway,  Through the valley,  It's a long road through the night. It's a long road. Hear a stranger's voice in the front yard. Let the arrow's tip past the deadline. Get another stamp in your passport. Wash your breakfast down with some red wine. Delete the progress on your game. Try to fall asleep while your eyes ring,  From the loudest songs on your mixtape. I can dance to anything you wanna sing. No reason.  No  Action.  No silence.  No  I'll peer. Nobody came running up by my side. It's the first time that  I'm worried,  Of a bad dream, of a journey, on the highway,  Through the valley,  It's a long road through the night. It's a long road. To get it right. It's the first time that  I'm worried,  Of a bad dream, of a journey, on the highway,  Through the valley,  It's a long road through the night. It's a long road.

Day dream near a stream with a winter bite Oh,  I listen to the song on repeat from the other night And  I can't picture you but  I sure got the feelin' right What a crazy world, pretty little girl And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news When you reach for my hand  I was scared in your room We fell on the floor and we started to move And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop Up my back they would climb just as  I came unglued She said if you break my heart then  I'll change your mind And  I'll do it again If you play the part then  I will play mine And  I'll do it again If we miss the mark if we hold on tight We'll be there to try it again Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor Your eyes they came alight as you're dreaming of our future home And the kids are growing up as you and  I we are growing old What a crazy world, pretty little girl In the rain with a drink from the back of the bar I'm raising my voice, you raise it up more We forget that our lives have been apart it is hard We thought we are close but it still feels far And we learn to get by if we learn to have scars We learn to forgive and accept who we are You said if you break my heart then  I'll change your mind And  I'll do it again If you play the part then  I will play mine And  I'll do it again If we miss the mark if we hold on tight We'll be there to do it again Wait a minute hold up a second Don't leave me here with this feelin Like  I'm the one for regrettin Like  I never did coke for a spoke Like  I never did pulled out that weapon And stick that knife through my back Was  I supposed to accept it when your words are like More than just sticks and stones kinda like a bullet I don't tip that lies in my bones and  I can't just swallow it My pride is more than all that  I own so  I gotta give it away Some of the times  I'm all the way wrong but can't you see past Me and see my fucked up home that made me the meanest The devil is just singin along to the song  I write to alone at night And  I hang up the phone and bite my tongue Cause  I know that me and you is just only right, but oneâ¦ It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot Every year has been great and a few have been tough And the kids they will reach for the stars up above I said relax we cheer in the morrow All the ropes to the life from the crypt to the grave We started alone in the end we're okay You said if you break my heart then  I'll change your mind And  I'll do it again If you play the part then  I will play mine And  I'll do it again If we miss the mark if we hold on tight We'll be there to try it again

 I'm wasting time thinking about a girl And stealing her away from her world She and  I would run away I think of all the things that  I'd say We'd talk about important things And  I picture it in my dreams She'd teach me about modern art And  I'd show her it's okay to fart and Maybe  I'd impress her By being in a band and Maybe if  I act real tough She'd let me hold her hand and Maybe  I'll win her heart By writing this song about her Sometimes  I sit at home and Wonder if she's sitting at home Thinking of me and wondering if  I'm Sitting at home, thinking about her Or am  I just wasting my time Remembering how she laughed at  Kinko's When  I made fun of that guy Remebering the look she gave me When  I told her that  I used to fry I really want to ask her out But my ego could never take it And even if  I got the balls You know that the  Cougar would never make it And in my town you can't drive naked And maybe  I'd impress her By being in a band and Maybe if  I act real tough She'd let me hold her hand and Maybe  I'll win her heart By writing this song about her Sometimes  I sit at home and Wonder if she's sitting at home Thinking of me and wondering if  I'm Sitting at home, thinking about her Or am  I just wasting my time Am  I just wasting my time Am  I just wasting my time Am  I just wasting my time Wasting my time thinking about a girl

My friends say  I should act my age What's my age again?  What's my age again? Then later on On the drive home I called her mom from a pay phone I said  I was the cops And your husbands in jail The state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me Nobody likes you when you're 23 And  I'm still more amused by prank phone calls What the hell is call  I.

 I woke up today Surrounded by blackness The small morning sun  Devoured the process  It's always been fine When  I get a bit nervous  And it's hard to say But  I feel a bit weightless The more  I admit I feel a bit anxious  The more  I go on The less  I can face this And those rotten things That live in our shadow We walk on the line Of death and the gallows In hope that we clear A path we can follow  It's the worst damn day (it doesn't hurt that much) Of my life I made a mess today (it doesn't hurt that much) But  I'm alright (it doesn't hurt that much)   When  I was young The world it was smaller The cities were vast The buildings were taller I felt really strong My parents seemed stronger My life has a way It showers with greatness Then takes it away Those pieces that made us Then teach us the things You'd never imagine  We all get the same The memories, the burdens  The pictures we made They still form a pattern They cautiously say Does it all matter?  It's the worst damn day (it doesn't hurt that much) Of my life I made a mess today (it doesn't hurt that much) But  I'm alright (it doesn't hurt that much  It's the worst damn day (it doesn't hurt that much) Of my life I made a mess today (it doesn't hurt that much) But  I'm alright (it doesn't hurt that much   It's the worst damn day (it doesn't hurt that much) Of my life I made a mess today (it doesn't hurt that much) But  I'm alright (it doesn't hurt that much  It's the worst damn day (it doesn't hurt that much) Of my life I made a mess today (it doesn't hurt that much) But  I'm alright
 Why Since you were born you watched tv Cartoons with violence and greed In your world all that was ok Your parents never taught you right From wrong, brother taught you to fight Now it's time to show them what you've got Gotta show them what you've got An attitude, a fancy car Your buddies got your back Your parents' house compared to yours Looks something like a shack In your thirty seven guns The bullets spanked red A simple stare is all it takes To fill 'em up with lead but Why, Are you acting like you're someone else? Why, Can't you stop thinking about yourself Last friday night you went driving A stolen car with golden rings It was something you just had to do Your little friends the cops caught you You're sentenced for a long time Now tell me what you're gonna do In a world where no one cares Labels  I don't wanna wear I had a dream that  I could once walk Safely in the streets You've got to take it away yeah You've got to take it away from me Why, Are you acting like you're someone else? Why, Can't you stop thinking about yourself
