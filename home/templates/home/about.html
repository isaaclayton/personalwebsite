<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Isaac Layton and I'm a new data scientist. I graduated from California Polytechnic State University in 2016 with a degree in statistics and currently perform supply chain analytics at a camera support company. My interests include machine learning, data visualization, and natural language processing. I'm currently seeking full-time employment and would love to get in contact with you to talk about how I can help your company make data-driven decisions. </p>
