<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Isaac Layton and I'm a new data scientist. I graduated from California Polytechnic State University,  in 2016 with a degree in statistics and currently do supply chain analytics at a camera support company. My interests include machine learning, data visualization, and natural language processing. I'm currently seeking employment and would love to get in contact with you to talk about how I can positively impact your company.</p>
<p>This website will be used to display projects that I work on as I continue to learn.</p>
