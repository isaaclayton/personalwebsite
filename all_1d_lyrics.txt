 Been a lot of places. I've been all around the world. Seen a lot of faces. Never knowing where  I was. On the horizon, Oh, well  I know  I know  I know  I know the sun will be rising Back home. Living out of cases. Ain't packing up and taking off. Made a lot of changes, But not forgetting who  I was. On the horizon, Oh, well  I know  I know  I know  I know the moon will be rising Back home. Don't forget where you belong! Home Don't forget where you belong! Home If you ever feel alone, Don't. You were never on your own, And the proof is in this song. I've been away for ages. But,  I've got everything  I need. I'm flicking through the pages I've written in my memory. I feel like  I'm dreaming. Oh, so  I know  I know  I know  I know  I'm never leaving. I won't go. Don't forget where you belong! Home Don't forget where you belong! Home If you ever feel alone, Don't. You were never on your own, And the proof is in this song. Lights off when they should be on. Even stars in skies they're wrong. Short days when the nights are long, When  I think of the things  I've done. Don't matter how far  I've gone I'm always feeling like home! Don't forget where you belong! Home Don't forget where you belong!( Don't forget it) Home If you ever feel alone, Don't. You were never on your own Never, never, never. Don't forget where you belong!

You don't know you're beautiful But that's what makes you beautiful So cc-come on you got it wrong To prove  I'm right  I put it in a so-o-ong I don't know why you're being shy And turn away when  I look into you're ey-ey-eyes Everyone else in the room can see it Everyone else but you,yeah Baby you light up my world like nobody else The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell You don't know Oh! Oh! You don't know you're beautiful If only you saw what  I can see You'll understand why  I want you so desperately Right now  I'm looking at you and  I can't believe You don't know Oh! Oh! You don't know you're beautiful But that's what makes you beautiful!
 It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside I'm not one of those who can easily hide I don't have much money, but boy if  I did I'd buy a big house where we both could live I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song It's for people like you that keep it turned on And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple, but now that it's done I hope you don't mind,  I hope you don't mind that I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple, but now that it's done I hope you don't mind,  I hope you don't mind that  I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world
